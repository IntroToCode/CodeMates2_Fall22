## Equipment needed:

Oven and Stove

## Steps for preparation:

Step 1
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. On a sheet pan, toss together the
mushrooms, gnocchi, 5 tablespoons olive oil, scallions and shallot.
Season with salt and pepper, shake into an even layer, and roast
without stirring until the gnocchi and mushrooms are golden and
crisp, 20 to 25 minutes. Add the spinach and remaining tablespoon of
oil, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Spread in an
even layer, then return to the oven to roast until the spinach is tender,
another 5 to 7 minutes.
 
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the mustard, horseradish and
honey until combined. Season with salt and pepper.
 
Step 3
Add the butter and half the sauce to the sheet pan, and stir until
melted and glazy. Eat with the remaining sauce on the side.
